Toronto emotional speech set (TESS)

Dataset : kaggle datasets download -d ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess

This dataset contains 2800 audio recordings of 200 target words spoken in the phrase, each portraying seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pleasant surprise, sadness, and neutral. The recordings are stored in WAV format, organized by actress and emotion.

Key Analyses:
- **Emotion Recognition**: Ideal for training models to classify emotions based on speech using features like pitch and tone.
- **Age Comparison**: Allows for studying how age affects emotional expression in speech.
- **Acoustic Features**: Analysis of pitch, intensity, and speech rate across different emotions.
- **HCI Applications**: Useful for improving voice-driven emotion-sensitive interfaces like virtual assistants.
- **Speaker-Dependent/Independent Models**: Enables model training both specific to and generalized across speakers.

This dataset offers a structured way to explore emotional and age-related variations in speech, benefiting fields like emotion recognition and human-computer interaction.
